                    A startup with the mission to heal the planet. This service allows people track their handprints (another word for positive impacts). You can invite friends to track their handprints too. When your friends sign on, their handprints become parts of yours.

                    <p class="small white-text">
                        The customer came with a request to make an easy system of relationships between users. If one person “inspires” another to take good action (online or offline), there must be a simple functional in the system to register this. It was necessary to come up with a simple and understandable move for each case.

                    <p class="small white-text">
                        We decided to assign each person their own ID code in the system. And they also gave him the opportunity to customize it to make it more memorable. Now, the user, let us name his Lucy, can verbally invite another user Jake to take positive action and report his ID code. And if Jake registers this action on the Handprinter, he is able to mention Lucy using Lucy's ID.

                        In the future, the project is planned to be expanded to the whole world, and during the discussion with the client we found out that the site is going to be shown in 30+ languages, starting from English, German, Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Chinese. For the designer, this meant that it was necessary to choose a font that has a sufficiently large number of localizations to make the site look equally good in any of the languages.

                        We decided to use the Noto family. It has a very large number of localizations and is available in the public domain on Google Fonts.

                                There was a decision to put an icon in each category. "Face" icon for human health impact category, "planet" - for climate, "tree" - for the ecosystem, etc. According to the concept of service, all impacts are measured in time units. So we concluded to create a color hierarchy. The most powerful impacts (that count in days) are labeled by blue color, less powerful - “hours” -  emerald green and tiny “minutes” - salad green. The negative impact, that is also possible, is gray and the icon is crossed-out. A combination of color, icons and text allows signs to be understandable for both - people with normal vision, and with any color blindness.
